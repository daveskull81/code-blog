This repo houses all of the content for my home page on the internet. Originally I planned on having it be a more traditional blog, hence the name, but instead I use it as a place to provide information about me as a Software Developer. More writing about code and my experiences in tech can be found on my [Dev.to](https://dev.to/daveskull81) page instead.  
If you have any questions for me on this feel free to reach out on the Contact page linked from my [site](https://www.daveinden.com).
