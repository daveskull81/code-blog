I am currently going through the Full Stack Web Development course at [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com) working to graduate in Spring of 2020. Here is a collection of both Lambda School projects (made for assignments during the coursework) and personal projects(being an idea of mine and solely of my own design). They reflect my current progress in the course and as a Full Stack Web Developer. Below you will see the projects grouped by the various technologies and methodologies used to create them.

## **Refugee Stories**

**Lambda School Project**

I was put together with multiple students in a team and tasked with building two static pages to be a landing site for our project. One was to be a home page and another to provide information about the team members doing the work. The project was to build an application called Refugee Stories where displaced people can come to share their story of being a refugee. By helping them share their stories others can learn more about the real people at the heart of the refugee crisis.
