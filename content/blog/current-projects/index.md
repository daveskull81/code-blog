I am currently pursuing an education in Full Stack Web Development at Lambda School. Outside of that I have a few other projects.  
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://dancing-vikings.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dancing Vikings</a></li>
    <p>- My open source game "company" I use to focus my learning by making fun projects.</p>
    <li>My tech sticker book collection</li>
    <p>- I collect tech & dev related stickers in a book rather than putting them on my computer.</p>
    <li>Writing</li>
    <p>- I write about my experiences with tech and web development on my <a href="https://dev.to/daveskull81" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dev.to</a> page.</p>
</ul>
